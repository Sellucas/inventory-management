# Inventory Management System

This is a study project focused on inventory management, developed with the goal of exploring and practicing the use of AWS services. Most of the data is mocked, as the main purpose of the project is to learn and configure deployment and cloud infrastructure services.

## Technologies

- **Express.js** and **TypeScript** to build the API.
- **Prisma ORM** for database management.
- **PostgreSQL** as the database.
- **Next.js** as the React development framework.
- **MUI** for the data table interface.
- **TailwindCSS** for responsive design and styling.
- **Redux** for global state management.
- **AWS EC2** For deploying the backend application.
- **AWS RDS** For hosting the PostgreSQL database.
- **AWS API** Gateway To manage and scale the system APIs.
- **AWS Amplify** For deploying the frontend (Next.js).
- **AWS S3** For file storage.
